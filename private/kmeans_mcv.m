function [ix, C] = kmeans_mcv(x, k, varargin)
%KMEANS_MCV use the kmeans algorithm to partition one dimensional data
%
%   [ix,C] = KMEANS_MCV(x,k) partitions the data in x into k clusters. The
%   cluster indicies are returned in ix and the centroid values are
%   returned in C. Initial center locations are initialized as the mean of
%   the data plus/minus the standard deviation of the data.
%
%   [ix,C] = KMEANS_MCV(x,k,iC) same as above but give initial guesses for
%   the center locations.
