function Delay_est=ITS_delay_est(x_speech,y_speech,mode)
%Usage: Delay_est=ITS_delay_est(x_speech,y_speech,mode)
%
%This function estimates the delay history for the speech samples in
%y_speech relative to the speech samples in x_speech.
%
%x_speech and y_speech are row or column vectors of speech samples
%with sample rate 8000 samples/sec. At least 1185 samples (148 ms)
%is required in each vector.
%
%mode='f','v', or 'u' for fixed delay, variable delay or unknown delay type
%
%Delay_est holds estimates of the delay of the speech samples in y_speech
%relative to speech samples in x_speech. Typically y_speech contains
%samples from the output of some system under test, and x_speech contains
%the corresponding input samples. Delay_est then holds estimates of the
%delay of that system under test.
%
%Delay_est is 2 by n, with one row for each segment of constant delay.
%Column 1 holds the number of the last sample of a segment of constant
%delay, column 2 holds the estimated delay for that segment. Here are two
%examples:
%
%Example 1 Delay_est=[32000,17] means that a single delay estimate of 17
%samples applies to all 32000 samples in y_speech
%
%Example 2 Delay_est=[12345,-2
% 32000,400]
%means that for samples 1 through 12345, the delay is estimated to be -2
%samples. For samples 12346 through 32000, the delay is estimated to be
%400 samples.
%
%In addition, the output [0 0] indicates no delay estimation was possible.
%This can happen when x_speech and y_speech contain unrelated signals,
%or no signal at all.

function rho=single_corr(x_speech,y_speech,start,stop,delay)
%Usage: rho=single_corr(x_speech,y_speech,start,stop,delay)
%This function calculates a single correlation value between
%a segment of x_speech and y_speech. The goal is to use the
%samples of y_speech from "start" to "stop" inclusive and the
%corresponding portion of x_speech, but shifted forward in time
%by the number of samples specified in "delay."
%These segments may be shortened as necessary if not enough
%samples are available.
%The correlation is direct-form and is performed by the
%function non_fft_xc_all
%First sample of x_speech that will be used
sstart=start-delay;
lefttrim=0;
%If that sample does not exist
if sstart<1
    %It is necessary to shift the start of the correlation window
    lefttrim=1-sstart;
    sstart=1;
end
%Last sample of x_speech that will be used
sstop=stop-delay;
ns=length(x_speech);
righttrim=0;
%If that sample does not exist
if sstop>ns
    %It is necessary to shift the end of the correlation window
    righttrim=sstop-ns;
    sstop=ns;
end
%Extract speech from correlation window and rectify
x=abs(x_speech(sstart:sstop));
y=abs(y_speech(start+lefttrim:stop-righttrim));
%Perform unnormalized correlation
[rho,denom]=non_fft_xc_all(x,y);
%Normalize to find correlation value
